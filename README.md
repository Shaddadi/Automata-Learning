FnLI(): estimates linear inequalities for changepoints in the traces\
FnPTA(): generates state transitions with guard conditions\
FnGenerateHyst(): generates a hybrid automation in Hyst data structure\
FnHyst2State(): converts Hyst data structure to Stateflow data structure

Run ```git submodule update --init --recursive``` to pull hyst
