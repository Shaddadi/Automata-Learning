# Automata-Learning
This framework coontains functions as follows:\
FnClusterSegs(): it clusters trace segments\
FnEstODE(): it estimates ordinary differential equations from the clustered trace segments\
FnLI(): it estimates linear inequalities for changepoints in the traces\
FnPTA(): it generates state transitions with guard conditions\
FnGemerateHyst(): it generates a hybrid automation in Hyst data structure\
FnHyst2State(): it converts Hyst data structure to Stateflow data structure
